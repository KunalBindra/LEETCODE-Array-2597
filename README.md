# LEETCODE-Array-2597
The provided Java solution aims to find the number of "beautiful" subsets in an array `nums` given an integer `k`. A subset is considered "beautiful" if the absolute difference between any two elements in the subset is not equal to `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the solution works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `kMaxNum`: A constant representing the maximum value an element in `nums` can have.
   - `count`: An array to keep track of the frequency of each number in `nums`.
   - `modToSubset`: A map that groups numbers by their modulo `k` values, each entry contains a sorted set of numbers.

2. **Processing `nums`**:
   - Loop through each number in `nums`:
     - Increment its count in the `count` array.
     - Group numbers by their modulo `k` values in `modToSubset`.

3. **Variables for Dynamic Programming**:
   - `prevNum`: Keeps track of the previous number processed, initialized to `-k` to ensure it doesn't interfere with the first comparison.
   - `skip` and `pick`: Used to maintain counts of beautiful subsets when skipping or picking a number, respectively.

4. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - Iterate through each subset in `modToSubset`:
     - For each number in the subset:
       - Calculate the number of non-empty subsets for the current number.
       - Update `skip` to the previous value of `pick`.
       - Update `pick` to include new beautiful subsets formed by adding the current number, considering constraints on `k`.
     - Adjust `prevNum` to the current number after processing.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - Return the sum of `skip` and `pick` which represents the total number of beautiful subsets.

Here is the same code with added comments for clarity:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
  public int beautifulSubsets(int[] nums, int k) {
    final int kMaxNum = 1000; // Maximum value for an element in nums
    int[] count = new int[kMaxNum + 1]; // Frequency array for nums elements
    Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> modToSubset = new HashMap<>(); // Map to group numbers by their mod k value

    // Populate count and modToSubset
    for (final int num : nums) {
      ++count[num];
      modToSubset.putIfAbsent(num % k, new TreeSet<>()); // Create a new TreeSet if mod group doesn't exist
      modToSubset.get(num % k).add(num); // Add num to the appropriate mod group
    }

    int prevNum = -k; // Initialize prevNum to -k to avoid interference in the first loop
    int skip = 0; // Subset count when skipping current num
    int pick = 0; // Subset count when picking current num

    // Process each subset in modToSubset
    for (Set<Integer> subset : modToSubset.values())
      for (final int num : subset) {
        final int nonEmptyCount = (int) Math.pow(2, count[num]) - 1; // Calculate non-empty subsets for current num
        final int cacheSkip = skip; // Cache the current skip value
        skip += pick; // Update skip to include previously picked subsets
        pick = nonEmptyCount * (1 + cacheSkip + (num - prevNum == k ? 0 : pick)); // Update pick with new subsets
        prevNum = num; // Update prevNum to the current num
      }

    return skip + pick; // Return the total number of beautiful subsets
  }
}
```

This code efficiently calculates the number of beautiful subsets by utilizing dynamic programming principles and careful handling of subsets based on modulo values and the `k` constraint.
